## About
AI News is an artificial intelligence-based application that enables users to converse verbally and search for news information.

## Context
This was a personal project built with React.JS and deployed using Heroku. The application makes use of an API called Alan AI, which enables the creation of predefined capabilities for voice recognition. Additionally, the program makes use of the bootstrap and material design libraries to allow quicker UI development. The challenge with this application was that it was my first AI-based online application, and thus I needed to study up on the fundamentals of implementing certain functionalities. I primarily learned it via viewing online tutorials and forums, as well as by reading the Alan Ai documentation.
