## About
Sorting is a web-based application that allows users to visualize the most common sorting algorithm in computer science.

## Context
This was a personal project built with React.JS and deployed using Github Pages. The application allows users to visualize sorting algorithms and perform additional actions such as being able to choose the speed of the sorting and have a button for sounds. This project was tough to build, but with many youtube tutorials and learning, it can be done!
